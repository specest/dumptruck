### This is work in progress

Â´dumptruck' tries to identify the mysql server version by looking at the files in mysql data directory.
It then spins up the correct mysql container with podman, mounts the data directory, queries the database and dumps the tables of your choosing. 


It relies on the `file` and `find` utilities and should work on MacOS and Linux. 

### How to use

Just run the binary and follow the instructions or give the mysql data directory path as the first argument to the executable,
e.g: `dumptruck .` if you are in the mysql data directory or `dumptruck /path/to/data/dir`. It doesn't handle relative paths yet, WIP.
